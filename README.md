# Managing Complex Change

An interactive reference for the Lippitt-Knoster model of managing complex change.

Every failed change initiative is missing at least one ingredient. The symptom tells you which one. This page helps you find the gap, understand what you're seeing, and know what to do about it.

## The Model

Five ingredients are required for successful change:

| Missing Ingredient | Symptom |
|---|---|
| Vision | Confusion |
| Skills | Anxiety |
| Incentives | Resistance |
| Resources | Frustration |
| Action Plan | False Starts |

## Features

- Expandable detail cards for each ingredient and failure mode
- Interactive diagnostic tool — toggle which ingredients are present and get a prediction
- Single self-contained HTML file, no build step

## Attribution

Based on work by Dr. Mary Lippitt (1987), Anthony Ambrose (1987), and Tim Knoster (1991).
